### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Esther. I'm a trainee engineer.

My background is in Chemistry but I've been coding for a couple years now and officially made the jump to a tech role in 2022.

So far, I've learned Python, SQL, HTML, AWS basics and Docker basics. I've worked on SQL tuning and analysis of AWR/NMON reports.

I'm currently learning Java and would like to work towards certifications to back up my skills.

The journey into tech has not been easy but it sure has been interesting. If you're wondering how I'm doing, see below for my daily morning ritual...
